# Ryan Lubell

I'm a QA/Data Analyst and Python Developer focused on building clean, testable pipelines for automated data validation, cleaning, and reporting. My background in design and marketing taught me how to ship projects efficiently and communicate clearly — skills I now apply to building and testing data workflows that actually work.

Currently, I’m building tools that leverage Python, pandas, and APIs to automate repetitive validation tasks and support better decision-making. I care about clear structure, readable code, and testing everything before it goes out the door.

## Projects

- **[API Data Validation Tool](https://github.com/rylub/api_data_validation)**  
  CLI tool that fetches live crypto prices, validates against JSON schemas, and reports changes with automated testing and CI.

- **[NASA APOD Data Pipeline](https://github.com/rylub/nasa-apod-data-qa-pipeline)**  
  A modular pipeline for fetching, validating, and reporting on NASA APOD API data for QA workflows.

- **[Data Validation Tool](https://github.com/rylub/data-validation-tool)**  
  Scripted pipeline for cleaning, validating, and visualizing structured CSV datasets, using pandas and matplotlib.

  - ****[Spotify Dashboard](https://github.com/rylub/spotify-dashboard)****
